# Computer Architecture – Coursework & Experiments

## Overview

This repository contains my **Computer Architecture coursework and experiments**, focused on understanding how architectural design choices impact processor performance. The work goes beyond theory and includes **benchmark-driven simulations** and analysis of real architectural trade-offs.

---

## What I Did

* Ran **SPEC-style benchmarks** (e.g., `mcf`, `hmmer`) using a processor architecture simulator.
* Explored multiple architectural configurations by varying key parameters such as **cache sizes and microarchitectural structures**.
* Collected and analyzed performance metrics from simulation outputs (`stats.txt`) to study performance, latency, and efficiency trends.
* Compared results across configurations to understand **memory hierarchy behavior and architectural trade-offs**.
* Used structured configuration files (`.ini`, `.json`) and generated configuration visualizations (`.dot`, `.pdf`, `.svg`) for analysis.

## Key Concepts Covered

* Processor datapath and execution behavior
* Memory hierarchy and cache performance
* Architectural parameter exploration
* Performance analysis and benchmarking

---

## Purpose

This work demonstrates a strong foundation in **computer architecture and performance analysis**, supporting my interests in **Digital Design, RTL development, CAD/EDA, and SoC-level engineering roles**.

---

## Notes

* This repository represents **academic coursework and controlled experiments**.
* Emphasis is on architectural understanding and analysis rather than RTL implementation.
