# Design for Testability (DFT) – Coursework Repository

## Overview

This repository contains my **Design for Testability (DFT)** coursework, covering key concepts and practical exercises related to testing digital ICs. The material reflects a mix of theoretical understanding and hands-on problem solving, aligned with standard industry practices used in ASIC design and validation.

The assignments focus on fundamental DFT topics such as fault modeling, test generation, scan-based design concepts, and test analysis, which are critical for ensuring manufacturability and silicon quality.
